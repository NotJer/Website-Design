# Educational Seattle University geared towards Computer Science 

The website that we decided to create will be an educational one containing other helpful website links and articles for computer science classes. The idea is similar in nature to GeeksForGeeks but geared towards computer science students who struggle to grasp common theory. 
	Included in this website we will have major categories like fundamentals of programming, Data structure, AI, syntax for various languages, etc. From those categories, we will have a YouTube-like structure to show articles and videos from other trusted creators. Finally, ideally, we would have a few code runners of sorts so users can test what they have learned quickly through our website. Ideally, the website would contain both a place where you can learn about a topic, and also a learning part where users can practice and get tested on the knowledge that they just learned. 
	Our website will be educationally directed and tailored towards a specific user-based, computer science. There are other educational websites available that have computer science as a topic but do not specifically focus on computer science. Students in computer science who struggle with many of the major topics will see this website as a very important tool to further their education. 
Overall we are trying to solve the problem of people searching YouTube for lessons about computer science. The problem YouTube has is the ease of posting videos without any reference or background in the topic. This allows anyone, even someone with no educational background to be put in a teaching position possibly teaching fake/false information. With our website, the content will be regulated more with only trusted sources allowed to link their page/post an article.
