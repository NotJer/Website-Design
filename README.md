# Educational Seattle University - Computer Science Website

The website we decided to create is an educational platform containing helpful links and articles for computer science classes. The idea is similar to GeeksForGeeks but specifically geared towards computer science students who struggle to grasp common theory.

## Key Features
- **Major Categories**: Fundamentals of programming, data structures, algorithms, and syntax for various languages, etc.
- **Content Structure**: A YouTube-like structure to display articles and videos from trusted creators.
- **Interactive Learning**: Code runners for users to test what they have learned quickly through our website.
- **Dual Learning Approach**: Sections for learning about a topic and practicing/testing knowledge.

## Target Audience
Our website is educationally directed and tailored towards computer science students. While other educational websites cover computer science as a topic, they do not specifically focus on it. Students struggling with major topics in computer science will find this website a valuable tool to further their education.

## Problem and Solution
We aim to solve the problem of students searching YouTube for computer science lessons, where the ease of posting videos can lead to unverified and potentially false information. Our website will regulate content more strictly, allowing only trusted sources to link their pages or post articles.

## Conclusion
By providing a focused, reliable, and interactive learning platform, we hope to support computer science students in their educational journey.
